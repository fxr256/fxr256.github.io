Hi, I'm Felix. I've been working in software development since 2011. This blog is a collection of my thoughts on various topics in professional software development. Focus topics are clean code, automated tests, anti-patterns, object orientation and scalable team organization. The blog is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The name "Thinking Sideways" is inspired by this quote out of Jim Butcher's [Codex Alera](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45545-codex-alera) series:
>Thereâ€™s something broken inside your skull, Calderon. You do all your thinking sideways.
