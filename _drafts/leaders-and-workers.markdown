Something strange happens in big development organisations: The speed of progess no longer strongly correlates with the number of people. This is not too surprising given the higher needs for communication and coordination and probably cannot be avoided. However, this effect is stronger in some organizations rather than in others. In any case, you will end up with people who don't "work". From my point of view "work" when developing software is limited to four activities: 
- Writing Code
- Managing your own infrastructure
- Selling the product
- Doing customer support

If you follow this definition, you will notice that a significant percentage of your workforce doesn't actually work. How high this percentage is clearly varies from company to company. What do these people do? Some of them can be lumped into "supporting" rules. They many work in human ressources, work as assistants to managers / teams or they might take care of the book keeping. How many people you need in those supportive rules is unclear: Young companies tend to have very few supporters, while bigger / older companies have quite a lot of them. While they may drain the companies funds, they generally don't get in the worker's way. More interesting are the people that do. The men and women pulling the strings and making the decisions. The *leaders*. They come in various forms: Some leaders are your superiors and hence have direct influence over your doings. Others have only indirect / soft influence over you. They might be software architects or product owners,
