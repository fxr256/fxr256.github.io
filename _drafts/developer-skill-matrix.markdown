It seems obvious at first glance that some developers are much better at their job than others. After all, we know that some football players are better than others and we also know that some lawyers are better than others, so why shouldn't this be true for developers as well? In fact, there are [studies](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/180512-is-there-a-10x-gap-between-best-and-average-programmers-and-how-did-it-get-there/fulltext) backing this claim. Furthermore, this variance in productivity is known in parts of the industry. For example, [Alan Eustace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Eustace) gave this statement in an [interview](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113271436430704916):
> One top-notch engineer is worth "300 times or more than the average," explains Alan Eustace, a Google vice president of engineering. He says he would rather lose an entire incoming class of engineering graduates than one exceptional technologist. Many Google services, such as Gmail and Google News, were started by a single person, he says.

There are lot of things one can nit-pick about either the studies or Mr. Eustace's statement. Nevertheless, I think it is foolish to dismiss these findings: Developer productivity does indeed vary greatly between individuals. Furthermore, science indicates that people with roughly the same level of performance are often found in different teams / companies. That means that high-performer like to hang out with other high-performers and vice versa.

One big problem is that there is no proper way to [measure productivity](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html). Many different metrics have been suggested in the last years. All of them are [deeply flawed](https://nortal.com/de/blog/the-myth-of-developer-productivity/). Nevertheless, this does not mean that we can ignore this variance. We still have to manage it and this is the point of this article.
