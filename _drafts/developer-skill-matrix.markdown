It seems obvious at first glance that some developers are much better at their job than others. After all, we know that some football players are better than others and we also know that some lawyers are better than others, so why shouldn't this be true for developers as well? In fact, there are studies backing this claim. The first was already done in the seventies and found an order of magnitude difference between mediocre and outstanding developers. The other studies have achieved similar results even though way they measured developer performance wavered. 

I don't want to critique the studies in detail, as I lack the necessary time and access to the study details. However, it is clear that we can accept that developer performance does indeed vary greatly between individuals. Furthermore, science indicates that people with roughly the same level of performance are often found in different teams / companies. That means that high-performer like to hang out with other high-performers and vice versa.

One big problem of all these studies is that there is no proper way to measure productivity.
