To cover:
	Tests don't raise quality
	Tests can only proof the existence of bugs, not their absence
	No "fig-leave" testing
	You need to adress the findings
	If you have poor quality, testing is not the answer
	Manual testing is a poor investment
	Guided manual testing is dehumanizing and pointless
