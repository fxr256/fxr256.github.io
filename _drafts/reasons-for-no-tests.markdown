How much of your code is covered by automated tests? Chances are, the precentage is not as high as you would like. In my time as a software developer, I have worked in code-bases with a high coverage as well as in onces with barely any tests at all. I vastly prefer the former as a good automated test suite speeds up development and makes it much easier to determine whether the current state of the code is ready for production. The advantages of automated testing is well-known in the industry, but automated testing has never reached the ubiquity one might expect given its advantages.
