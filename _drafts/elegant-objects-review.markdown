I like to read about software development. As you are reading a blog about this topic right now, chances are that you share the same hobby. However, there is so much material out there that it is hard to decide what to read in our limited spare time. Today, I want to make this decision a bit easier by recommending a book: [Elegant Objects](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29326350-elegant-objects) by Yegor Bugayenko. You might be familiar with Yegor as he is a [blogger](https://www.yegor256.com/) himself. He is known for his strong and often polarizing opinions.
